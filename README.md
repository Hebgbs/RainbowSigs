#Rainbow sigs

Modification made by Blue Flame  
One-click mirror and batch scripts by Bad Minotaur

###ABOUT 
This set of files are modified animations, recolouring the stock heavy attacks (signatures) for all characters to become multi-coloured and pretty.

This mirror is provided as a service to the Brawlhalla community for ease of installation. All content comes from Blue Flame's Google Drive, which is publically accessible from this URL;    https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0U9_heTQ-WabFRWaFFGRDZqeDA&usp=sharing

###BATCH SCRIPT
See file "How to batch.txt" for specific information about that.

###MODIFICATION INFO
See `READ ME.txt` for information about updates.
Date is also in the revision number when `startInstall.bat` is executed.

I will announce updates @ https://discord.gg/0f8NrHSFtWCwFeLJ
